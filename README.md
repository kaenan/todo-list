## About the TODO list web application project.

This project was not only to familiarise myself with Larvel, but also to practice using Ajax calls.

The end goal of the project was to allow a user to create mulitple todo list objects, and update the items within each list without the page needing to reload. This would be done by using Ajax calls to POST data, and use the return to dynamically update the elements.
